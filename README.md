# Raspkate
Raspkate is a simple and small web server that can run on either Windows or Linux (with Mono). Raspkate was developed with Microsoft C# on .NET Framework 4.5.2, it is simple and small, but can serve static files as well as the lightweight RESTful requests, which makes Raspkate to be the best choice when you need a lightweight web server to host your Single Page Applications (SPAs).

Raspkate can also be used in [Raspberry Pi](http://raspberrypi.org "Raspberry Pi") (RPi) in conjunction with a 3rd party GPIO library to provide HTML5 enabled web user interface for controlling the GPIO ports. Raspkate can run on a [Raspberry Pi 2 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/) with a Windows IoT core installed, or even in [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b/) and [Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/model-b-plus/), Raspkate can still work perfectly when Mono is successfully installed.
